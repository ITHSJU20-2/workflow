# Project Workflow
1. Project idea
    1. What are we going to do?

2. Project contents
    1. Methods

        2. NoSQL
    1. External libraries?
    2. Graphical interface?
3. Divide the work between the members
4. Create a repository
5. Start writing the code
    1. Always use Gradle to avoid cross-platform compatibility issues since we are on different operating systems. **Unless other information is given**
6. Communicate between eachother to avoid missing vital parts of the code that you might need for your part of the project.
7. Check Github often to avoid missing vital parts of the code that you might need for your part of the project.
8. Push code to Github often. ***It's easier to rewrite 4-5 lines rather than 4-5 files***
9. When approaching a finished codebase:
    1. Start creating a mockup for the graphical interface **If needed**
10. Let everyone speak about the design
    1. Likes and dislikes
11. When agreed upon a design
    1. Divide the work between the members
    2. Start implementing the design while working closely together
12. When approaching a finished design:
    1. Generate UML
    2. Generate Javadoc **If needed**
